### **Introduction:**

In the field of machine learning, building a model is just the first step. The real challenge lies in **maintaining its accuracy over time**. One of the most common issues that machine learning models face is **model drift**. In this article, we will explore **what model drift is, why it occurs, and how to address it in your machine-learning workflows**.

### **Definition:**

**Model drift** is a phenomenon where the **statistical properties of the target variable change over time**, leading to a **degradation in model performance**. In simpler terms, when the variables used to **make predictions on a particular system change over time**, the **accuracy of your model can be affected**, and it **can lead to errors in your predictions**.

### **Examples:**

To understand model drift better, let us consider a few examples. Suppose we build a model that **predicts demand for smartphones** based on various parameters such as **age, income, gender, location,** etc. These parameters, **collectively called features**, were used initially to **train the model, and it was performing well on the training dataset**. However, when a **new feature such as the pandemic** emerged these older features that **were being used earlier** might not have stayed that relevant then, or maybe some **features had gone missing** too. This may have **affected the accuracy** **of the model negatively** thus resulting in **monetary and temporal losses**.

Another example could be a scenario where a **company builds a model to predict stock prices** using historical data such as **volume, price, and news sentiment analysis**, but when the **environment changes**, for example, a **new government policy comes** in or a major **natural disaster**, it can **drastically change the stock prices**, and consequently, the **performance of the model is affected**.

### **Use Cases:**

**Model drift** can affect various industries which rely on machine learning **models to make decisions**. For example, **predictive maintenance models** in the **manufacturing industry** that are built to **predict equipment failure** **based on historical data can be affected by model drift**. **Healthcare prediction models**, such as those used to **predict readmission rates**, could **encounter drift due to changes in healthcare regulations, new treatments, or demographic shifts in patient populations over time**.

### **How to Address Model Drift?**

One effective way to address model drift is to **monitor your model's performance over time**. Having a **robust monitoring system in place can alert you to any changes in the data distribution**, allowing you to **identify and mitigate drift early on**. Some monitoring techniques **include statistical monitoring, continuous validation, and outlier detection**.

Another way is to **retrain the model periodically on newer data**, **keeping in mind the new variables and features that come up over time**. This would ensure that the **model stays up-to-date and can deal with dynamic and ever-changing environments**.

### Some Python libraries that can address the Model drift problem

1. [**TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)**](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/tfdv): TFDV is a library for exploring and validating machine learning data. It can be used to **detect and visualize changes in data distributions**, which can **help detect model drift**.
    
2. **s**[**cikit-multiflow**](https://github.com/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow): scikit-multiflow is a Python package for streaming machine learning that can be used to **monitor and update models in real-time**.

### **Conclusion:**

**Model drift can lead to inaccurate predictions**, and it is a phenomenon that **occurs when the variables that were used to make predictions on a particular system change over time**. This article has **highlighted some examples of model drift and the industries where it could make a significant impact.** We also discussed how to **address model drift through monitoring and retraining your models**. As the need for more accurate predictions is only growing, being aware and dealing with model drift becomes inevitable in **achieving successful and accurate predictions in machine learning**.
