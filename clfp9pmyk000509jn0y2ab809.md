### **Introduction**

**Optimization algorithms** play a crucial role in **training neural networks** to achieve **high accuracy and minimize the cost function**. There are several optimization algorithms available, each with its advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we will discuss the most commonly used optimization algorithms, including **Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, and Momentum-based Gradient Descent**. In the next article, we will include some more optimizers to keep this article short and crisp. We will provide **code snippets and use cases** to help you understand the differences between these algorithms and choose the right one for your neural network.

### **Optimization Algorithms**

The body of the article will include detailed explanations of the **selected optimization algorithms, along with code snippets and use cases** for each of them. The explanations will be clear and concise, with a focus on helping readers understand the **advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm**.

1. **Gradient Descent (GD):** This is a simple optimization algorithm that uses the **gradient of the loss function** **concerning the weights to update the weights**. The update rule is as follows:
    
    ```plaintext
    W = W - learning_rate * gradient_of_loss
    ```
    
    where **W is the weight vector**, **learning\_rate** is the step size, and **gradient\_of\_loss is the gradient of the loss function** concerning the weights. The learning rate controls the step size and is usually chosen to be a **small positive number**. GD is useful for **convex functions**, but **may not be efficient for non-convex functions**.
    
    * **Advantages**: It is **easy to implement** and can **converge to a global minimum** under some conditions.
        
    * **Disadvantages**: It can be **slow** and may **converge to a local minimum or saddle point**.
        

**Code:**

```python
# Initialize weights and learning rate
w = np.zeros((n_features, 1))
alpha = 0.01

# Perform gradient descent
for i in range(n_iterations):
    grad = compute_gradient(X, y, w)
    w -= alpha * grad
```

Here, `X` is the **input data**, `y` is the **target data**, `n_features` is the **number of features** in `X`, `n_iterations` is the **number of iterations** to run the algorithm, `compute_gradient` is a function that **computes the** **gradient of the cost function**, and `alpha` is the **learning rate**.

**Use case**: GD is often used as a baseline optimization algorithm for **simple neural networks with small datasets**.

1. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: This is an extension of GD, where instead of **computing the gradient of the loss function over the entire training set**, the gradient is **computed for a single example at a time**. This can be **more efficient for large datasets and non-convex functions**. The update rule is as follows:
    
    ```plaintext
    W = W - learning_rate * gradient_of_loss_for_single_example
    ```
    
    where the **gradient is computed for a single example** at a time. The **learning rate** is usually chosen to be a **small positive number**.
    
    * **Advantages**: It is **faster than GD** and can **handle large datasets**.
        
    * **Disadvantages**: It can be noisy and may **get stuck in a local minimum**.
        
        **Code:**
        
        ```python
        # Initialize weights and learning rate
        w = np.zeros((n_features, 1))
        alpha = 0.01
        
        # Perform stochastic gradient descent
        for i in range(n_iterations):
            idx = np.random.randint(n_samples)
            grad = compute_gradient(X[idx:idx+1], y[idx:idx+1], w)
            w -= alpha * grad
        ```
        
        Here, `n_samples` is the **number of samples** in `X`, `idx` is a **randomly selected index**, `X[idx:idx+1]` and `y[idx:idx+1]` are the **input and target data** for the selected sample.
        
        **Use case:** SGD is often used for **training large neural networks** with **large datasets**.
        
2. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MBGD)**: This is a **compromise between GD and SGD**. In MBGD, the gradient is computed for a **small batch of examples at a time**, rather than a single example or the entire training set. This can be **more efficient than GD and more stable than SGD**. The update rule is similar to SGD:
    
    ```plaintext
    W = W - learning_rate * gradient_of_loss_for_batch_of_examples
    ```
    
    where the gradient is computed for a **small batch of examples at a time**. The **batch size** is usually chosen to be a **small positive number**.
    
    * **Advantages**: It is a compromise between GD and SGD, and can **converge faster than GD** while **being less noisy than SGD**.
        
    * **Disadvantages**: It requires **tuning the batch size**, and can still get **stuck in local minima**.
        
        **Code:**
        
        ```python
        # Initialize weights and learning rate
        w = np.zeros((n_features, 1))
        alpha = 0.01
        
        # Perform mini-batch gradient descent
        for i in range(n_iterations):
            idx = np.random.choice(n_samples, batch_size, replace=False)
            grad = compute_gradient(X[idx], y[idx], w)
            w -= alpha * grad
        ```
        
        This code implements a **mini-batch gradient descent optimization algorithm** for training a neural network. The algorithm is an extension of **standard gradient descent** and **stochastic gradient descent** and aims to **strike a balance between the two approaches**.
        
        At first, the **weights (w) of the neural network** are initialized to zeros. The **learning rate (alpha)** is also initialized.
        
        In each iteration of the optimization process, a **random subset of data (of size batch\_size)** is sampled from the entire training set using the **np.random.choice()** function. This **subset is referred to as a mini-batch**. The **gradient of the cost function** concerning the **weights is computed using the compute\_gradient() function**, but only on the **mini-batch data instead of the full training set**.
        
        Then, the **weights are updated by subtracting the gradient from the current weights**, scaled by the learning rate.
        
        This process is repeated for a **fixed number of iterations (n\_iterations)**, or until the **desired accuracy is achieved**.
        
        **Use case:** MBGD is often used for **training neural networks with moderate-sized datasets**, where a **compromise between GD and SGD** is desired.
        
3. **Momentum-based Gradient Descent**: This is an **extension of GD that incorporates momentum** to **help the optimization process converge faster**. In momentum-based GD, the update rule is modified as follows:
    
    ```plaintext
    velocity = beta * velocity + (1 - beta) * gradient_of_loss
    W = W - learning_rate * velocity
    ```
    
    where beta is a **hyperparameter between 0 and 1** that controls the contribution of the previous velocity. The momentum helps to **smooth out the fluctuations in the gradient** and **move the weights in the direction of the steepest descent**.
    
    * **Advantages**: It can **accelerate convergence** and **overcome saddle points**.
        
    * **Disadvantages**: It can **overshoot the minimum** and **require tuning the momentum parameter**.
        
        **Code:**
        
        ```python
        # Initialize weights, learning rate, and momentum parameter
        w = np.zeros((n_features, 1))
        alpha = 0.01
        beta = 0.9
        
        # Initialize velocity
        v = np.zeros((n_features, 1))
        
        # Perform momentum-based gradient descent
        for i in range(n_iterations):
            grad = compute_gradient(X, y, w)
            v = beta * v + (1 - beta) * grad
            w -= alpha * v
        ```
        
        This code implements a momentum-based gradient descent optimization algorithm for training a neural network. The algorithm is an **extension to standard gradient descent** and **aims to accelerate the convergence rate** and **prevent oscillations** that may occur when using standard gradient descent.
        
        At first, the **weights (w)** of the neural network are **initialized to zeros**. The **learning rate (alpha)** and **momentum parameter (beta)** are also initialized. The **momentum parameter (beta)** controls how much of the previous gradients should be taken into account when computing the current update. A **higher beta value** means **more of the previous gradients are considered in the update**.
        
        Next, an **initial velocity vector (v)** is initialized with the same shape as the weight vector. This velocity vector is used to store the momentum term. In each iteration of the optimization process, the **gradient of the cost function concerning the weights** is computed using the **compute\_gradient() function**. Then, the **velocity vector is updated using the momentum formula**, where the **new velocity is a weighted average of the current gradient** and the previous velocity. Finally, the **weights are updated by subtracting the velocity from the current weights**, scaled by the learning rate.
        
    
    The codes used above are just an illustration to explain the process the optimizers are using to perform the tasks. It serves as a skeleton code snippet. To get a detailed output, you must try out an **end-to-end problem to build a neural network model** from **Kaggle or Github**. This will also help to connect about **which optimizers are better** for **what kind of use case** at hand.
    
    ### **When to use what**
    
    * Use **GD if the dataset is small** and the **cost function is smooth and convex**,
        
    * Use **SGD if the dataset is large** and the **cost function is noisy or non-convex**,
        
    * Use **MBGD if you want a balance between GD and SGD**,
        
    * Use **momentum-based GD** if you want to **accelerate convergence and overcome saddle points**.
        

It's worth noting that **these are general guidelines**, and the **best optimizer depends on the specific problem and data at hand**. It's often a **good idea** to try out **multiple optimizers and compare their performance**.
